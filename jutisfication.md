#### Player interaction with the game and possible 
In the provided `Player` class:
- This class manages player-specific actions like moving workers and checking winning conditions, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. 
- Each player, identified by a unique ID, controls two workers, emphasizing the strategic element of positioning and movement on the game board. 
- The design choice to enforce rules within the `moveWorker` method, such as checking worker ownership and grid occupancy, aligns with ensuring game integrity and fairness.
- The `checkWinning` method's reliance on the grid's tower level to determine victory conditions illustrates a direct linkage between player actions and game outcomes.

#### The storage of current project:
-For futuren, I consider enhancing modularity for easier feature expansion, like adding new worker abilities or god powers. 

- Worker Positions: Stored within the Worker class. Each worker instance tracks its own position on the board, allowing the game to keep track of where each player's workers are located at any given time.

- Tower Levels on Grids: Managed by the Grid class. Each grid instance holds information about the level of the tower built on it, enabling the game to determine possible moves and builds, as well as victory conditions.

- Current Player: Maintained in the Game class. This class tracks which player's turn it is, ensuring the game flow proceeds in an orderly fashion.

- Game Status: Also within the Game class. It indicates whether the game is ongoing, has ended, or is in another state, facilitating game control and end-of-game scenarios.

- Winner: Identified and stored in the Game class once a winning condition has been met, allowing the game to announce the winner and conclude the session.
